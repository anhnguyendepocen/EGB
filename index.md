## Welcome to the Economics of Global Business

The Economics of Global Business is an intermediate level course in macroeconomics, with particular attention on international economics. The goal of this course is to provide a coherent framework for analyzing international macroeconomic events (e.g. long-run economic growth, the rise of globalization, recessions, and booms) and macroeconomic policies (e.g. monetary, fiscal, trade, and currency policy).
