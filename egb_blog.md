**What we did today 2/07...**

Finished up talking through the [in class example](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/EGB/raw/master/materials/week2/week2.egb_inclass_mpl.pdf) [Solutions here](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/EGB/raw/master/materials/week2/week2.egb_solutions_inclass_mpl.pdf).

Next class will talk about the "demand side", specifically the consumption funciton, investment function and how the real interest rate equilibrates everything. This will open up the door to thinking about how recent changes in taxes and government spending will affect interest rates.

**What we did today 2/07...**

Reviewed the production function, talked through marginal products of labor and then capital. Then the marginal products represendted the "demand" curve for labor and capital by the firm, the economies equilibrium wage rate is where the demand for labor and capital equal the supply of labor and capital. This pins down the real wage for labor and real rental rate for capital.

Finally, we talked through the first part of the [in class example](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/EGB/raw/master/materials/week2/week2.egb_inclass_mpl.pdf) on immigration. We will continue to work on this next class. [Solutions here](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/EGB/raw/master/materials/week2/week2.egb_solutions_inclass_mpl.pdf).

Problem set #1 is due THIS FRIDAY, Feb 9th. [Online quiz](https://goo.gl/forms/pwmFpKh79MeXfZXZ2) due this FRIDAY (Feb 9th) as well.

**What we did today 2/05...**

We talked about where value added comes from---the production function. Some properties of the production function: (1) More inputs lead to more outputs (2) Diminishing marginal products and (2) Constant returns to scale. We will focus most the course on [Cobb-Douglas production function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb%E2%80%93Douglas_production_function).

Then we started talking about payments to income. A key result was that the marginal product of labor equals the real wage. This is providing a theory of the real price paid to labor...why does somebody get paid a lot, well their marginal product must be high!

With the cobb-Douglas production function, it turns out that the marginal product will be proportional to its average product. Wags should be tied to labor productivity.

Finally, reminder. Problem set #1 is due THIS FRIDAY, Feb 9th. [Online quiz](https://goo.gl/forms/pwmFpKh79MeXfZXZ2) due this FRIDAY (Feb 9th) as well.

Update on my office hours: After class 11-12 and then 1-2 on Monday and Wednesday.

**What we did today 1/31...**

We finished up the GDP example. Solutions are [posted here](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/EGB/raw/master/materials/measurement/inclass_gdp_solutions.pdf). We then talked about measuring real GDP and inflation.

* Basic idea for real GDP, fix prices in some base year, then evaluate quantities over time (or space) at those fixed prices. This is real in the sense that only quantities are changing.

* Please look at the slides and discussion on the CPI. Its the opposite idea, fix quantities, then trace out how prices change.

* We talked about the population, labor force, unemployed, etc. Two measures we care about are the unemployment rate (unemployed / labor force) and participation rate ( labor force / population).  

Finally, reminder. Problem set #1 is due NEXT FRIDAY, Feb 9th.

**What we did today 1/29...**

Great conversation today, lots of questions. We talked more about measurement of GDP and started the in class example. Some key aspects:

* GDP = Value Added = Sales - material input costs. Key thing here is to reflect on the word...value added, this is how much value the Firm/Production unit, etc. ADDS!

* GDP = Payments to Labor and Capital. Well who created the value added, what did they get paid for doing so...the value added gets paid out to the workers and capital owners who created the value added. Not this concept must always match up with the value added concept above.

* GDP = Final Sales. Despite its ubiquity, this is the trickiest concept. Just look at the final sale (to consumers or firms for use in capital goods). That is all the value added in the economy. Why, that sale embeds all the value added to create the product/service/etc.

Next class, finish up GDP. Talk about real vs. nominal. Labor market performance measures.

**Some thoughts on the Dollar...**

This last week there was a lot of news about the current administrations conflicting views on the US Dollar. But this minor relative to the larger story about the dollar...its systematic weakening for much of 2017 and into 2018. All after an unprecedented appreciation of the dollar from about 2011-the start of 2017. Ok, what gives...this is why we are here in EGB to be able to think through this systematically!

Here are three nice articles about the Dollar. If you are to read one, focus on the [Economist piece](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21735024-whether-currency-cheap-or-dear-not-always-good-guide-its-fortunes-it-now-value). A couple of others that discuss similar issues are the [FT's Gavin Davies (this should be free to Stern students)](https://www.ft.com/content/0a4f1c98-02ab-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5) and [another from the WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investor-thirst-for-foreign-stocks-may-be-speeding-dollars-decline-1517157713). A couple of things:

* First, reflect on how much you DON'T understand. Its ok, that's why we are here, but by the end of the semester we will revisit this.

* Second, all are pointing to the following...expectations of monetary policy in EU are forecasting tighter conditions. Asset returns elsewhere in the globe are expected to be high...WHY? Its all about **economic growth** in the EU (in particular) and elsewhere. The Economist piece makes this point up front.

Why do I point this out, many of the things we read and discussed about at the end of the day are about economic growth. And that's why we work on this first. Then as the semester progresses we will be able to work backwards and see how these stories behind dollar weakness make a lot of sense.

**What we did today 1/24...**

Great class! We talked through two key things:
 - [Computing growth rates](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/EGB/raw/master/materials/measurement/notes_growth_rates.pdf), we will most always use continuously compounded growth rates, i.e. take the difference of the natural logarithm. For us there are two important properties, average growth rates over time are easy to compute and interpret, and multiplicative values (e.g. P*Q) can be easily decomposed into their individual components.
 - GDP. We focused on the key idea that it reflects, value added, income, and then final sales...and they all must equal each other.

 Next class, we work through measuring GDP in a more [complicated example](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/EGB/raw/master/materials/measurement/inclass_gdp.pdf).

**What we did today 1/22...**

After each class meeting, I will try and provide a brief summary of what we did each day...here it is!

We talked about what kinds of topics we will cover, I discussed important course details covered on the syllabus. And I introduced myself to you. Very great first day.

A couple of things to follow up on if you have not done so already.

**Read the [Syllabus](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/EGB/raw/master/materials/syllabus/syllabus_waugh_egb_spring_2018.pdf).**

**[Take the online survey](https://goo.gl/forms/SHPrtRM5rBcKXtUj2).** The link is here:

**Welcome to The Economics of Global Business!**

In a week we will have our first meeting and get the semester started. I want to reach out to you about some features of this course to help you prepare for the semester ahead.

**Read the [Syllabus](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/EGB/raw/master/materials/syllabus/syllabus_waugh_egb_spring_2018.pdf).** I've posted the syllabus for the upcoming semester. This has information about important dates, texts, grading, etc. Please take some time to go over this prior to our first class meeting.

**[Take the online survey](https://goo.gl/forms/SHPrtRM5rBcKXtUj2).** This [link](https://goo.gl/forms/SHPrtRM5rBcKXtUj2) has the survey for you to complete. As the syllabus details, there will be a bunch of online quizzes throughout the semester. This is the first one. It just asks questions about your background and as long as you complete it, you'll receive full credit. And you have until Jan 31st to complete it---so no rush if your still on vacation!

**Explore the [website](https://mwaugh0328.github.io/EGB/).** I've the designed website to provide a bunch of information about the course in a simple way. In particular, the main week by week guide of the course.

I'm looking forward to meeting you all and a great Spring semester!
