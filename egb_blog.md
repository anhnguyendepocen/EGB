**What we did today 1/24...**

Great class! We talked through two key things:
 - [Computing growth rates](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/EGB/raw/master/materials/measurement/notes_growth_rates.pdf), we will most always use continuously compounded growth rates, i.e. take the difference of the natural logarithm. For us there are two important properties, average growth rates over time are easy to compute and interpret, and multiplicative values (e.g. P*Q) can be easily decomposed into their individual components.
 - GDP. We focused on the key idea that it reflects, value added, income, and then final sales...and they all must equal each other.

 Next class, we work through measuring GDP in a more [complicated example](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/EGB/raw/master/materials/measurement/inclass_gdp.pdf).

**What we did today 1/22...**

After each class meeting, I will try and provide a brief summary of what we did each day...here it is!

We talked about what kinds of topics we will cover, I discussed important course details covered on the syllabus. And I introduced myself to you. Very great first day.

A couple of things to follow up on if you have not done so already.

**Read the [Syllabus](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/EGB/raw/master/materials/syllabus/syllabus_waugh_egb_spring_2018.pdf).**

**Welcome to The Economics of Global Business!**

In a week we will have our first meeting and get the semester started. I want to reach out to you about some features of this course to help you prepare for the semester ahead.

**Read the [Syllabus](https://github.com/mwaugh0328/EGB/raw/master/materials/syllabus/syllabus_waugh_egb_spring_2018.pdf).** I've posted the syllabus for the upcoming semester. This has information about important dates, texts, grading, etc. Please take some time to go over this prior to our first class meeting.

**[Take the online survey](https://goo.gl/forms/SHPrtRM5rBcKXtUj2).** This [link](https://goo.gl/forms/SHPrtRM5rBcKXtUj2) has the survey for you to complete. As the syllabus details, there will be a bunch of online quizzes throughout the semester. This is the first one. It just asks questions about your background and as long as you complete it, you'll receive full credit. And you have until Jan 31st to complete it---so no rush if your still on vacation!

**Explore the [website](https://mwaugh0328.github.io/EGB/).** I've the designed website to provide a bunch of information about the course in a simple way. In particular, the main week by week guide of the course.

I'm looking forward to meeting you all and a great Spring semester!
